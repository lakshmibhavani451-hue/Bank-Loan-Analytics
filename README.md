# Bank-Loan-Analytics
Interactive Loan Analytics Dashboard built using tools like Excel, MY Sql, Power BI and Tableau to analyze loan performance, customer demographics, delinquency, defaults, and revenue trends. The dashboard features key KPIs, slicers, and visuals across regions, products, age groups, branches, and loan status to support data-driven decision-making.
📌 **Project Overview**
